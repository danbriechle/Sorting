# Sorting

## About
Ruby play ground for sorting an array of numbers manually. In the event your interviewer wants you to not call .sort()
to get at your algorithmic thinking (read as: "Do you have a comp sci degree?")
While this is not relevant to anything you may do on the job it is certainly a barrier to entry in 2023.
